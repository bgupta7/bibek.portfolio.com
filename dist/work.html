                <h2 class="text-secondary">I'm not superstitious</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not superstitious. Only a blind person, one who is impaired both
                    visually and
                    intellectually would suffice to overwhelm their short graceful life with grand beliefs justified by
                    trivial reasons. Must he not be a fool? Or is he so despicable that the only thing keeping him
                    decent is divine intervention, the perpetual fear of the Lord’s wrath. Why would he suggest a
                    misfortune to occur after crossing the path intersected by a black cat?
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, enough gibberish. I do not wish any negative energy engulfing me
                    today, only
                    blissful optimism, just like yesterday. And yesterday was amazing. Started out a little odd though
                    with me brushing my teeth twice to give those whites a clean shine after I had a heavy breakfast.
                    Then, I found a quick solution to a hurdle: my wet backpack, drenched by the incessant rain the
                    day before, was effortlessly replaced by my brother’s cooler version, which was thankfully
                    available, saving me the embarrassment of carrying my dad’s ancient book-holder with straps.
                    Yesterday, I missed my bus as well but a benevolent guy viewing me distressed at the bus stop
                    gave me a ride to school. Do you see now? This was how my day was rolling out. Monotonous
                    troubles that were magically being resolved. It was like an antibody with binocular vision
                    preparing beforehand to tackle a virus. You could almost sympathize for the cruel parasite. Oh,
                    and did I tell you about how beautiful she looked. I watched her all day, yet all her moves were
                    so unpredictable, and still are. How could she do all this? Eliciting a response of what I perceive
                    as true love even though all our lengthy conversations have been a few seconds of casual
                    greetings accompanied by that glistening smile of hers. I didn’t even know her that well. But,
                    being an expert on myself, I definitely knew how I felt about her. So, with equal amount of
                    courage and fear, I took a leap to exchange some dialogue to inquire what she thought of me: am
                    a pervert whose vicious eyes discomfort her or a secret admirer she wishes to be revealed.
                    Fortunately, all we did was talk instead of diving into the explanations of bewildering emotions.
                    For the moment, whatever it was, it’s effect was splendorous. Talking to her felt great.
                    <br> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, enough about yesterday. Today, I brushed my teeth twice
                    again even though
                    those whites didn’t need any additional cleansing. My backpack was completely dried up, yet I
                    chose to lengthen the borrowing period by carrying on with my brother’s bag. He required it
                    today, so I left the house early without even asking him for it. And now, it’s half past eight. I
                    still
                    have 30 minutes to reach my stop. No student would like to walk the long arduous road to school
                    and on a day when I’m this early, the possibility of missing the bus is close to none. So, why are
                    my feet slowing down, almost to the point of a complete stand still? Why do I want to miss my
                    bus? Am I being so foolish as to think that repeating yesterday’s actions will yield in the same
                    result; that wonderful scenario where I get to talk to her again. But I am not superstitious.</p>
